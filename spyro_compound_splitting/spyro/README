                Swedish Python Routines (SPyRo)



This is a small Python library for managing the SALDO lexicon, including
compound splitting.


    INSTALLING

Simply copy this directory into your PYTHONPATH.

First you need to download saldo.xml and saldom.xml from Språkbanken:

  http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/sblex/resources#saldo
  http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/sblex/resources#saldom

Then create a directory indicated by DATA_PATH in saldo.py (you may want to
change this variable). This is where the SALDO database will be written to.
Run the xmlsaldo script:

  python xmlsaldo.py saldo.xml saldom.xml

After about five minutes, you should be ready to go.


    USING

splitter.py can also be used to split compounds on the commandline:

  python splitter.py glasskål NN
